# Financial Controls Management (FCM) in IBM OpenPages

## Overview

Since the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, organizations have been struggling to contain costs and reduce the complexity associated with financial reporting regulations. While most companies have been able to meet their financial compliance requirements, many are also plagued with manual procedures that are labor-intensive.

Manual processes typically increase costs and likelihood of potential errors. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve, organizations that create flexible, sustainable and a repeatable compliance infrastructure for financial controls, will be well prepared to meet new challenges.

IBM OpenPages Financial Controls Management is a financial controls management solution that reduces the costs and complexity of complying with Sarbanes-Oxley and similar global financial reporting regulations. 

Leveraging a core, shared services and open architecture, IBM OpenPages Financial Controls Management automates the ongoing scoping, testing, reviewing, attestation, and remediation process and helps organizations to meet their financial compliance obligations.
